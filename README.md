Some projects that I have done in free time. I am largely self-taught so this repo, is a showcase of my learning.

## 1. CLIP-Seg + SAM segmentation
Implementation of simple panoptic segmentation using CLIPSegmentation model (https://huggingface.co/blog/clipseg-zero-shot) and then refining the low-resolution mask with Segment Anything(https://segment-anything.com/) by prompting it with points sampled within the low-res mask from CLIPSeg.

## 2. Segment Anything model prompting ##
Trying out Segment Anything model from MetaAI with bounding box prompts. In this case, we give the bounding box coordinates to the model of the ROI and generate the a high-quality segmentation.
